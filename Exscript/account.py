        The authorization password is only required on hosts that
        separate the authentication from the authorization procedure.
        If an authorization password is not given, it defaults to the
        same value as the authentication password.

        If the `needs_lock` argument is set to True, we ensure that no
        two threads can use the same account at the same time. You will
        want to use this setting if you are using a central authentication
        server that allows for only one login to happen at a time.
        Note that you will still be able to open multiple sessions at the
        time. It is only the authentication procedure that will not happen
        in parallel; once the login is complete, other threads can use
        the account again.
        In other words, the account is only locked during calls to
        :meth:`protocols.Protocol.login` and the `*authenticate*` methods.

            Setting `lock` to True drastically degrades performance!

        a callback function that is invoked to decide whether or not the
        given pool should be used for a host.

        When Exscript logs into a host, the account is chosen in the following
        order:

            # Exscript checks whether an account was attached to the
            :class:`Host` object using :class:`Host.set_account()`), and uses that.

            # If the :class:`Host` has no account attached, Exscript walks
            through all pools that were passed to :class:`Queue.add_account_pool()`.
            For each pool, it passes the :class:`Host` to the function in the
            given match argument. If the return value is True, the account
            pool is used to acquire an account.
            (Accounts within each pool are taken in a round-robin
            fashion.)

            # If no matching account pool is found, an account is taken
            from the default account pool.

            # Finally, if all that fails and the default account pool
            contains no accounts, an error is raised.

        Example usage::

            def do_nothing(conn):
                conn.autoinit()

            def use_this_pool(host):
                return host.get_name().startswith('foo')

            default_pool = AccountPool()
            default_pool.add_account(Account('default-user', 'password'))

            other_pool = AccountPool()
            other_pool.add_account(Account('user', 'password'))

            queue = Queue()
            queue.account_manager.add_pool(default_pool)
            queue.account_manager.add_pool(other_pool, use_this_pool)

            host = Host('localhost')
            queue.run(host, do_nothing)

        In the example code, the host has no account attached. As a result,
        the queue checks whether use_this_pool() returns True. Because the
        hostname does not start with 'foo', the function returns False, and
        Exscript takes the 'default-user' account from the default pool.
